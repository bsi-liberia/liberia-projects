## Quarterly update of disbursement data

In the past, it took a lot of effort each quarter to update disbursement data for every donor. This is now much simpler and faster, if you follow these steps:

1. On the [Export Data](/export) tab, scroll down to `Excel reporting templates`
2. Select a template to download.
3. Send the template _as an email attachment_ to the relevant donor. Ask them to update the quarterly disbursements column.
4. Review the file you receive back from the donor and check the numbers make sense.
5. On the [Export Data](/export) tab, scroll down to `Import data from quarterly reporting template`
6. Upload the file you received back from the donor. All projects will be updated according to the data entered into the file by the donor.

## Generating reports

There are several ways you can generate reports from the system.

1. If you want to generate an export of all activities, you can do so on the [Export Data](/export/) tab:
   * **Export data in Excel Format** will export data according to AMCU's existing Excel format.
   * **Download detailed AMCU financial transactions data for analysis** provides a more detailed and advanced format, useful for time-series analysis.
   * **Download integrated dataset of AMCU and PSIP projects** follows the same format as the AMCU Excel format, but includes also PSIP projects.
2. If you want to generate an export of a subsection of activities, you can filter for activities on the [Activities](/activities/) tab and then click `Export selection to Excel`.
